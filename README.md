# OpenWhip

![Whip divider](assets/divider.png)

Sometimes claude code is going too shlow, and you must whip him into shape..

Or pat him on the shoulder. Your call.

## Install + run

This fork is not on npm yet. Install straight from GitHub (Node 18 to 24; Node 26 breaks electron's installer):

```bash
npm install -g github:shmulc8/OpenWhip
openwhip
```

windows and mac supported out of the box, but Linux is a special snowflake so you need to install `xdotool` for keyboard automation

```bash
sudo apt install xdotool
```

## Controls

- Click the Dock or tray icon, or press `Option+Shift+W` (`Alt+Shift+W`): spawn whip.
- Right-click tray icon: quit.
- Flick, then click while the whip is snapping: that is a strike. It sends an interrupt (Ctrl-C) and one of the encouraging messages!
- A click with a still whip does nothing. Fast flicks alone crack with sound and sparks but never type.
- Right click: drop whip.
- Smash the bottles on the shelves for points. Fast hits in a row multiply the score; your best is kept.

## Pat on the shoulder

For the days he deserves it. Press `Option+Shift+P` (`Alt+Shift+P`) or pick it from the tray menu: a hand follows
your mouse. Left click pats him, sends a kind word (no interrupt, just the message and Enter) and floats some hearts.
Right click waves goodbye. From a terminal, `openwhip pat` summons the hand and `openwhip` the whip.

## macOS setup

On first run `openwhip` builds `OpenWhip.app` inside the package (a renamed, re-signed copy of the bundled
Electron with the whip icon) and launches it through `open`, so macOS sees an app called OpenWhip rather
than your terminal. Typing into the focused app needs Accessibility access for it: when macOS prompts,
open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility and turn on **OpenWhip**. If it is not listed:

```bash
open -R "$(npm root -g)/openwhip/OpenWhip.app"
```

Drag it onto the list and turn it on.

If `openwhip` prints `Could not load Electron` on Node 26, electron's postinstall failed to unzip its binary.
Reinstall on Node 22 or 24 (`nvm use 24 && npm install -g openwhip`).
